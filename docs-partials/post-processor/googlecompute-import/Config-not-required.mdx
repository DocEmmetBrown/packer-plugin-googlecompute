- `access_token` (string) - A temporary [OAuth 2.0 access token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)
  obtained from the Google Authorization server, i.e. the `Authorization: Bearer` token used to
  authenticate HTTP requests to GCP APIs.
  This is an alternative to `account_file`, and ignores the `scopes` field.
  If both are specified, `access_token` will be used over the `account_file` field.
  
  These access tokens cannot be renewed by Packer and thus will only work until they expire.
  If you anticipate Packer needing access for longer than a token's lifetime (default `1 hour`),
  please use a service account key with `account_file` instead.

- `account_file` (string) - The JSON file containing your account credentials. Not required if you
  run Packer on a GCE instance with a service account. Instructions for
  creating the file or using service accounts are above.

- `credentials_file` (string) - The JSON file containing your account credentials.
  
  The file's contents may be anything supported by the Google Go client, i.e.:
  
  * Service account JSON
  * OIDC-provided token for federation
  * Gcloud user credentials file (refresh-token JSON)
  * A Google Developers Console client_credentials.json

- `credentials_json` (string) - The raw JSON payload for credentials.
  
  The accepted data formats are same as those described under
  [credentials_file](#credentials_file).

- `impersonate_service_account` (string) - This allows service account impersonation as per the [docs](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/impersonating-service-accounts).

- `vault_gcp_oauth_engine` (string) - Can be set instead of account_file. If set, this builder will use
  HashiCorp Vault to generate an Oauth token for authenticating against
  Google Cloud. The value should be the path of the token generator
  within vault.
  For information on how to configure your Vault + GCP engine to produce
  Oauth tokens, see https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/gcp
  You must have the environment variables VAULT_ADDR and VAULT_TOKEN set,
  along with any other relevant variables for accessing your vault
  instance. For more information, see the Vault docs:
  https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/#environment-variables
  Example:`"vault_gcp_oauth_engine": "gcp/token/my-project-editor",`

- `scopes` ([]string) - The service account scopes for launched importer post-processor instance.
  Defaults to:
  
  ```json
  [
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"
  ]
  ```

- `gcs_object_name` (string) - The name of the GCS object in `bucket` where
  the RAW disk image will be copied for import. This is treated as a
  [template engine](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine). Therefore, you
  may use user variables and template functions in this field. Defaults to
  `packer-import-{{timestamp}}.tar.gz`.

- `image_architecture` (string) - Specifies the architecture or processor type that this image can support. Must be one of: `arm64` or `x86_64`. Defaults to `ARCHITECTURE_UNSPECIFIED`.

- `image_description` (string) - The description of the resulting image.

- `image_family` (string) - The name of the image family to which the resulting image belongs.

- `image_guest_os_features` ([]string) - A list of features to enable on the guest operating system. Applicable only for bootable images. Valid
  values are `MULTI_IP_SUBNET`, `UEFI_COMPATIBLE`,
  `VIRTIO_SCSI_MULTIQUEUE`, `GVNIC` and `WINDOWS` currently.

- `image_labels` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair labels to apply to the created image.

- `image_storage_locations` ([]string) - Specifies a Cloud Storage location, either regional or multi-regional, where image content is to be stored. If not specified, the multi-region location closest to the source is chosen automatically.

- `skip_clean` (bool) - Skip removing the TAR file uploaded to the GCS
  bucket after the import process has completed. "true" means that we should
  leave it in the GCS bucket, "false" means to clean it out. Defaults to
  `false`.

- `image_platform_key` (string) - A key used to establish the trust relationship between the platform owner and the firmware. You may only specify one platform key, and it must be a valid X.509 certificate.

- `image_key_exchange_key` ([]string) - A key used to establish a trust relationship between the firmware and the OS. You may specify multiple comma-separated keys for this value.

- `image_signatures_db` ([]string) - A database of certificates that are trusted and can be used to sign boot files. You may specify single or multiple comma-separated values for this value.

- `image_forbidden_signatures_db` ([]string) - A database of certificates that have been revoked and will cause the system to stop booting if a boot file is signed with one of them. You may specify single or multiple comma-separated values for this value.
